# A Gameshow On Rails: Ta-boolean
A Ruby On Rails game created for [RailsConf 2022](https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#session-1304)


## How To Play
### Ta-boolean rules
Ta-boolean is played similar to Catch Phrase/Taboo/Heads Up:
- A person or team (clue-giver) is shown/handed a card with a word or phrase
- The clue-giver then tries to get a person or team (guesser) to say the word or phrase
- The clue-giver cannot say the phrase, or the 'reserved words' listed on each card.
- In the spirit of the game, the clue-giver should try to *explain* the concept, not use word-play or parallel concepts. e.g. if the word is 'gem', the guesser shouldn't say: "This word rhymes with hem" or "A precious stone".

### Daily Test-Doubles
As a fun surprise, "Daily Test-Doubles" were inserted randomly into the game. These included audio from a 5-year-old asking curious questions with no single answer (e.g. "Whats coding?", "How much does the internet weigh", etc)


### Game structure
At RailsConf, Ta-boolean was played in a casual format with teams of two without keeping score. Cards were shown on a projected screen, and the two guessers faced the audience so that they could not see the screen.

Ta-boolean can be played in a similar format with any scoring rules. You could also use the printable cards and play without a screen.

## What's in this repo



## Future development
Please use this game as you wish! Future development could include making a web-application version of the game, and/or splitting the cards up into categories/values, allowing players to pick which category/value they want to attempt next (ala Jeopardy!).
